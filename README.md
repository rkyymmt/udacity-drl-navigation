# Project Details
- The README describes the the project environment details (i.e., the state and action spaces, and when the environment is considered solved).

# Getting Started
- The README has instructions for installing dependencies or downloading needed files.

# Instructions
- The README describes how to run the code in the repository, to train the agent. For additional resources on creating READMEs or using Markdown, see here and here.


## Training Code

- Training Code
    - The repository (or zip file) includes functional, well-documented, and organized code for training the agent.

- Framework
    - The code is written in PyTorch and Python 3.

- Saved Model Weights
    - The submission includes the saved model weights of the successful agent.

## Suggestions to Make Your Project Stand Out!
- Include a GIF and/or link to a YouTube video of your trained agent!
- Solve the environment in fewer than 1800 episodes!
- Write a blog post explaining the project and your implementation!
- Implement a double DQN, a dueling DQN, and/or prioritized experience replay!
- For an extra challenge after passing this project, try to train an agent from raw pixels! Check out (Optional) Challenge: Learning from - Pixels in the classroom for more details.
