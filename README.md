## Suggestions to Make Your Project Stand Out!
- Include a GIF and/or link to a YouTube video of your trained agent!
- Solve the environment in fewer than 1800 episodes!
- Write a blog post explaining the project and your implementation!
- Implement a double DQN, a dueling DQN, and/or prioritized experience replay!
- For an extra challenge after passing this project, try to train an agent from raw pixels! Check out (Optional) Challenge: Learning from - Pixels in the classroom for more details.
